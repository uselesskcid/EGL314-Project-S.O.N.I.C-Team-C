</p>

## Overview

Project S.O.N.I.C. is an experiential/exploratory initiative designed to blend the ancient “ninja training techniques” with modern technology. All of its stations are designed to be player interactive, simulating ninja training.

Its fifth station, titled Memory Sequence, is a test involving the memory of hearing. Players will listen to a complex sequence of a variety of sounds, and listen out for a specific type of sound being played. After the sequence ends, the players must indicate how many times the sound is played, and from what direction it came from.

A Master station shall be used, where every station shares the same master laptop, lighting console, the lighting fixtures, the digital audio mixer, and the 12 speaker outputs.

## Requirements for pre-installation

Before installation, it is important to have the following software on your laptop:

Lighting:

- [grandMA3 on PC](https://www.malighting.com/downloads/products/grandma3/) (This is the software to run and control lighting sequences)

Audio:

- [LoopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) (Create virtual loopback MIDI ports to connect apps needing MIDI ports for communication)
- [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php)(Digital Audio Workstation to use for inserting sound effects)
- [L-ISA Controller](https://www.l-acoustics.com/products/l-isa-studio/) (Spatial object mixing software to create an immersive soundscape)
- L-ISA Processor (Installed with L-ISA Controller)
