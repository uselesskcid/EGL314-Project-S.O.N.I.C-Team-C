## Overview
Project S.O.N.I.C (Sensory Observation Ninja Immersive Challenge) is an experiential/exploratory initiative designed to blend the ancient "ninja training techniques" with modern technologies. Students are to design a range of interactive stations that simulate ninja training scenarios, designed to test and enhance your listening abilities, reaction times and strategic thinking. The stations include:
1. Stealth Walking
2. The Blindfold Challenge
3. Art Of Hearing
4. Reaction Training
5. **Memory Sequence** (Team C)
6. Graduation Sequence
<p>
  In this repository, the focus will be strictly on Station 5 - Memory Sequence.

## Station 5 - Memory Sequence
‚ÄúMemory Sequence‚Äù test and train your auditory memory.<br>
Participants are to listen, remember, and replicate complex sequences of sounds.<br>
Player to interact with a 360¬∞ customized touchpad to indicate the memory sequence.<br>
<br>
Only one Player interacting with MIDI Launchpad Pro MK3 (360¬∞ customized touchpad). <br>

  Features
</summary>
<ul>
  <li>L-ISA to create distinct sequences of sounds that vary in parameters (e.g. localizations, frequencies, etc) </li>
  <li>Adjustable difficulties where sequences can gradually increase in complexity (e.g. length, pitch, etc). </li>
  <li> Interactive Feedback ‚Äì teams may consider integrating visual and tactile feedback as hints or penalties. </li>
</ul>
